# PyBer_Analysis
Analyse rideshare data, writing Python scripts using Panda's libraries, jupyter notebook and metaplotlib to create visualtion for the analyse. 

## Overview of the analysis:
We just performed an exploratory analysis on data in some very large csv files, created several types of visualization to demonstrate a compelling story of the data. Crated a variety of charts to showcase the relationship between the type of city, and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city.This analysis helped PyBer, a Python-based ride-sharing app company, to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

After the initial analysis, V. Isualize, CEO of PyBer, has given us a new assignment. To use Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results:
1. Total rides for each city type.
      - Rural     125
      - Suburban  625
      - Urban     1,625

2. Total Drivers for each city type.
      - Rural     78
      - Suburban  490
      - Urban     2,405

3. total fares for each city type.
      - Rural     $4,327.93
      - Suburban  $19,356.33
      - Urban     $39,854.38

4. Average fare per ride for each city type.
      - Rural     $34.62
      - Suburban  $30.97
      - Urban     $24.53

5. Average fare per driver for each city type.
      - Rural     $55.49
      - Suburban  $39.50
      - Urban     $16.57

6. Total fares by city type between Jan and Apr
